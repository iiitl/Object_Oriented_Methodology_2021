For running the examples from Week 6, you need some header files and object files from Week 4.
To do so, download the Week 4 examples (including an updated makefile).
Assuming that "Week 4" and "Week 6" directories are in the same directory, issue the following commands:
make objects
cp Toy2.h Toy2.o ../Week\ 6
