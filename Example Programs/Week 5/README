For running the examples from Week 5, you need the header files and object files from Week 4.
To do so, download the Week 4 examples (including an updated makefile).
Assuming that "Week 4" and "Week 5" directories are in the same directory, issue the following commands:
make objects
cp *.h *.o ../Week\ 5
